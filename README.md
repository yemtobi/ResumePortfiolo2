#One-Page Resume Webpage

I designed this three-page resume website using HTML, CSS as part of Lab 1 for my CLCM3201: Introduction To Cloud Security course. The resume webpage aims to present my skills, qualifications, and experiences to potential employers in an aesthetically pleasing and well-organized format.


##Instructions On How To View The Webpage Locally:

###Pre - requisites

- I recommend that you use Google Chrome to view the webpage
- Any text editor can be used for viewing and editing code but I recommend using Bracket

###Instructions
1. Download a copy of my zipped webpage files to your local machine
   - Navigate to the project directory
   - unzip/extract the files

2. Open the portfioloindex.html(Page 1), resume.html(Page 2) and contactpg.html(page3) file:
   - Right-click on each file or open one of the files and navigate to other pages using the navigation links that I have added to each page
   - Select "Open with" and choose your preferred web browser (recommend Google Chrome)

3. Explore the website:
   - Interact with what I call my portfolio i.e. the 3-page portfolio and features.

###Additional Notes and Considerations
File Structure: 
Ensure the file structure is maintained for proper functionality.

CSS Styles:
If you make changes, ensure the linked CSS file (styleresume.css) is correctly referenced in the HTML.

Images and Assets:
Ensure that all images are kept in the appropriate folders and try not to rename the images as they have been referenced in the HTML codes.
